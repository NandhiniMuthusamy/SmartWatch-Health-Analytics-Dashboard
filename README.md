# SmartWatch-Health-Analytics-Dashboard
#1. Objective and Scope: Project Goals and Scope of Analysis:
The primary goal of this project is to utilize the data collected from a smartwatch to derive meaningful insights into individual health and fitness. The smartwatch records several important metrics, including steps taken, calories burned, distance covered, and heart rate. With this data, the objective is to explore how these variables interact, uncover patterns, and present findings that can guide individuals in optimizing their health and fitness routines. In addition, this analysis aims to examine how age groups and genders impact the relationships between these metrics, thereby helping target specific recommendations to enhance user health based on their demographic profiles.
Another significant goal of the project is to predict health outcomes like distance covered, using the available data. As a secondary aim, the project seeks to build a predictive model that estimates distance based on other health metrics, such as steps and calories burned, which could serve as a practical feature in future applications of wearable health devices. Understanding how these metrics change based on age and gender also allows for personalized health recommendations, making this analysis an essential tool for users seeking to enhance their fitness.

Scope:
The scope of the project involves several key components that together offer a comprehensive analysis of health and fitness data:
1.	User Activity Patterns: This area of the analysis seeks to identify how users interact with their wearable devices. By analyzing steps taken, calories burned, and distance covered, the project aims to understand activity levels across different age groups and genders. This will provide valuable insights into general trends in physical activity and highlight potential areas for health improvement.
2.	Segmentation by Age and Gender: One critical aspect of the project is to segment the data by age groups and gender to assess whether and how physical activity patterns differ based on these demographic factors. Age and gender can influence many aspects of physical health, such as metabolic rate, muscle mass, and cardiovascular capacity. Understanding these differences can help tailor fitness and wellness programs to specific groups.
3.	Distance Prediction: An exciting aspect of the analysis is the ability to predict distance covered based on other health metrics such as steps taken and calories burned. By building a predictive model, the project aims to determine how well steps and calories can be used to estimate the distance traveled by the user. This could be particularly helpful for users looking to track their walking or running distances automatically, without requiring additional sensors or manual input.
4.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA is the first step in uncovering hidden insights within the dataset. During this phase, the data is thoroughly examined to understand its distribution, relationships, and patterns. Visualizations such as scatter plots, histograms, and box plots will be used to detect trends, correlations, and outliers. EDA will help highlight interesting observations and guide further analysis.
5.	Correlation Analysis: A vital component of the project is to investigate how different health metrics correlate with each other. Specifically, the relationships between steps, calories burned, heart rate, and distance covered will be explored using correlation coefficients and visual techniques. These insights can highlight the most significant predictors of health outcomes and help refine the predictive models created in the project.
6.	Actionable Recommendations: Based on the analysis, the project will provide tailored recommendations for individuals to improve their health and fitness. These recommendations will be based on the patterns observed in the data and will focus on increasing activity levels, improving cardiovascular health, and optimizing calorie burn. By segmenting recommendations based on age and gender, the project will ensure that advice is personalized, relevant, and actionable.

#2. Methodology: -
Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Data was sourced from smartwatch devices that record various physical activity metrics, including steps taken, calories burned, heart rate, and distance covered. These measurements are automatically collected during daily physical activities and are stored in a database for analysis. The first step in the methodology is ensuring that the data is clean, complete, and ready for analysis.
1.	Handling Missing Data: Missing data in smartwatch datasets can occur due to several reasons, such as device malfunction, inactivity, or user neglect. In this project, missing values were handled by removing rows where essential data points (such as steps or calories) were missing, as these are crucial for accurate analysis. If a dataset was missing values in non-essential fields (like device type), it was either filled with a default value or excluded from non-critical analyses.
2.	Outlier Detection: Outliers can significantly skew the results of data analysis, especially in correlation or regression models. To identify outliers, visualizations such as box plots were used. Outliers were examined to determine whether they were errors (e.g., unusually high calorie burn or heart rate that didn’t align with user activity). Extreme outliers were removed to prevent their influence on the analysis, ensuring more accurate and reliable results.
3.	Data Normalization: To ensure that all metrics contributed equally to the analysis, the data was normalized using Min-Max scaling. This method adjusted all numeric variables (like steps and calories burned) to a common scale between 0 and 1. This prevents variables with larger ranges from disproportionately affecting the outcomes, particularly in correlation or regression analyses.

#3.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
During the EDA phase, various data visualizations and statistical tools were applied to understand the structure of the data and identify meaningful trends:
1.	Visualization of Data Distributions: Card Metrics were used to visualize the distribution of key metrics such as steps, calories burned, and heart rate, Distance Covered, Calories Burned per 1k Steps, Gender Wise Calories. This helped in identifying the central tendency and the spread of the data (range, interquartile range). These visualizations also allowed us to detect skewness, which can indicate whether a transformation is needed for more accurate analysis.
2.	Segmentation by Age and Gender: The data was divided into age groups (e.g., 18-34, 35-44, etc.) and gender (Male/Female) to examine if these factors influenced the physical activity levels of users. This segmentation was crucial for understanding the role of demographics in fitness patterns and how these patterns might vary by age and gender.
3.	Chart for Correlation: Column chart were employed to examine the relationships between different pairs of variables, such as steps vs. calories burned or steps vs. heart rate. These visualizations provided a clear picture of how closely related these variables were and helped identify the most impactful predictors of activity outcomes.

Correlation Analysis:
Correlation analysis is a crucial step in understanding the relationships between different variables. In this project, the following relationships were explored:
1.	Steps and Calories Burned: A strong positive correlation was expected between steps and calories burned, as taking more steps typically leads to a higher calorie expenditure. The Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated to quantify the strength of this relationship.
2.	Age and Activity Levels: Age was hypothesized to be negatively correlated with activity levels. As individuals age, they may experience a decline in physical activity due to reduced mobility, fitness levels, or other health factors. This correlation was calculated and visualized using scatter plots and Pearson’s coefficient.
3.	Heart Rate and Intensity: Heart rate was expected to correlate with the intensity of physical activity. Higher activity levels typically lead to higher heart rates. The correlation between heart rate and steps was examined to see how closely heart rate increased with activity.
Predictive Modelling for Distance:
The project aimed to predict the distance covered by a user based on their steps and calories burned. Using a simple approach, steps were multiplied by an average step length to estimate the distance. This model was tested for accuracy and compared to actual distance data, showing strong consistency between the predicted and observed values. By using this straightforward approach, the model provided actionable predictions without the need for more complex algorith
Tools Used:
1.	Power BI: The primary tool for data visualization and reporting, Power BI allowed the creation of dynamic and interactive dashboards. This enabled users to explore the data, track metrics over time, and analyze trends in real-time.
2.	DAX: DAX formulas were used extensively to create calculated columns and measures for metrics like total steps, calories burned, and distance. DAX also allowed for aggregating data by age group and gender, facilitating group-level analysis.
3.	Excel: Excel was used for initial data cleaning and small-scale visualizations before the data was imported into Power BI for larger-scale analysis.
Key Findings:
Age and Activity Levels:
o	Younger age groups (18-34 years) exhibited the highest step counts and calories burned, suggesting that younger individuals tend to be more physically active.
o	Older age groups (55+ years) showed a marked decline in both steps and calories burned, indicating a natural reduction in activity levels as individuals age.
Gender Differences:
o	Males generally covered more distance and burned more calories compared to females, possibly due to differences in muscle mass and metabolic rates.
o	Heart rate did not significantly differ between males and females when activity levels were normalized, suggesting that both genders experience similar cardiovascular responses to physical activity.
Correlation Insights:
o	Steps and Calories: A strong positive correlation was observed between steps and calories burned, which is intuitive since more steps directly correlate with higher energy expenditure.
o	Age and Activity: A negative correlation was found between age and both steps and calories burned, which aligns with the understanding that physical activity generally decreases with age.
Distance Estimation:
o	The simple calculation for estimating distance covered based on steps showed good results. Steps multiplied by an average step length provided an accurate approximation of the distance covered.

#4.	Practical Recommendations Based on Findings
Based on the findings, the following practical recommendations are provided:
1.	For Younger Age Groups (18-34 years):
o	Continue with or increase physical activity. This group tends to have a high activity level, but it is important to focus on maintaining overall health by engaging in a mix of strength training, cardiovascular exercises, and flexibility training.
2.	For Older Age Groups (55+ years):
o	Encourage regular moderate physical activity such as walking, stretching, and low-impact exercises to improve cardiovascular health and maintain muscle and bone strength. Regular activity can also help maintain mobility and prevent aging-related health issues.
3.	Gender-Specific Advice:
o	Females may benefit from engaging in more high-intensity exercise routines to boost both calories burned and fitness levels. Incorporating strength training and HIIT can increase the overall physical activity and contribute to better cardiovascular and metabolic health.
o	Males should focus on maintaining cardiovascular health and avoid high-intensity exercises that could lead to overtraining. Balancing strength training with aerobic activities is key.
4.	General Advice for All:
o	Aim to achieve at least 10,000 steps per day, which is widely regarded as a good target for maintaining overall fitness.
o	Those looking to improve cardiovascular health should consider gradually increasing the number of steps taken daily or incorporating more intense activities such as running or cycling into their routine.
